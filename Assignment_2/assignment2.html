        <p><i><span style="font-size: 30px ;">A long-term</span> shift in the typical weather patterns that have come to
                characterise local, regional, and global climates on Earth is referred to as climate change. Human
                activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, which raises the concentrations of heat-trapping
                greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere and thus increases the planet's average surface temperature, are
                to
                blame for the climate changes that have been observed since the middle of the 20th century. Internal
                variability and external forcings are examples of natural processes that can cause climate change but
                have
                been outweighed by human activity. Global warming is not a future issue. Increased human emissions of
                heat-trapping greenhouse gases are altering the Earth's climate, which is already having a significant
                impact on the environment. Glaciers and ice sheets are melting, lake and river ice is breaking up
                earlier,
                plant and animal ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming earlier. Here is a brief
                discussion
                of the causes of climate change and the importance in todays world.</i></p>

                <p><span style="font-size: 30px;"><b>Causes</b></span><br>The main cause of global warming which causes
                    climate change is inflicted by human activity. Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like
                    coal
                    and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The heat which is
                    created
                    by the sun, 90% of it gets absorbed by the atmosphere containing nitrous oxide, methane,
                    chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide and causes the atmosphere to heat up. Moreover, the
                    industrial
                    activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
                    by
                    nearly 50% since 1750, a great contributing factor on climate change. To a lesser extent, clearing
                    of
                    land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of
                    greenhouse
                    gases. Increase in population is also a huge contributing factor for climate change. As it stands, a
                    growth in population results in a rise of energy consumption which leads to energy loss and creates
                    more
                    global warming. It also leads to soaring deforestation, exhausted argicultural resourses and
                    drinking
                    water. Even the amount of transportation and vehicle needs accumulates, one of the main source
                    Carbon
                    Dioxide(C02) release.</p>

                <p><span style="font-size: 30px;"><b>Importance</b></span><br>Impacts of climate change may be observed
                    in
                    every area of the world we live in. However, the effects of climate change are not uniform
                    throughout
                    the nation and the world; even within a single city, different neighbourhoods or people may
                    experience
                    different effects. The effects of climate change on many societal segments are interconnected. Food
                    production and human health can be harmed by drought. Flooding has the potential to spread illness
                    and
                    harm infrastructure and ecosystems. Health problems can reduce worker productivity, raise mortality,
                    and
                    have an influence on the availability of food. Because of the rise of temperature, icebergs on the
                    nothern parts of the world are melting and causing sea levels to rise at a quicker rate. By a few
                    decades, large amount of lands will go underneath the ocean cause of the rise in sea levels.
                    Moreover,
                    climate change is already affecting human health. Hurricanes are becoming more intense and wetter as
                    ocean temperatures increase, which can result in both direct and indirect fatalities. Flooding more
                    often can increase the risk of chemical risks, accidents, and waterborne infections. The geographic
                    ranges of ticks and mosquitoes are expanding, and they can spread illness to new areas. And if these
                    serious consequences are not realizing and dealt with, there will be no point of return in the
                    future.

        <p><i>In conclusion, global action is urgently needed to address the significant threat posed by climate change.
                Climate change
                will have an impact on people's access to water, the ability to produce food, their health, and the
                environment. As the world heats, hundreds of millions of people might experience famine, water
                shortages, and coastal floods. According to a review done upon former economic models, the entire costs
                and hazards of climate change will be comparable to losing at least 5% of global GDP year, starting now
                and forever, if we don't take action. The estimated harm might reach 20% of GDP or more if a wider range
                of hazards and effects are included. As a result, it has become very relevant to tackle this situation
                as soon as possible.</i></p>
